## Under development

  - `httpapi plugin` - Zabbix API connector/wrapper. Used to manage hosts on Zabbix monitoring instance. Will extend [**zabbix_agent**](https://github.com/zabbix/ansible-collection/blob/main/roles/zabbix_agent/README.md) role to add hosts without autoregistration.

[Event-Driven Ansible integration](https://www.zabbix.com/integrations/ansible#event_driven_ansible) is based on webhook usage:
  - Zabbix media type pushes events to EDA;
  - EDA webhook receives incoming events and passes those to processing via rulebook.

EDA helps with automation of issue remediation and debugging tasks. Basically, EDA receives events sent from Zabbix and triggers different playbook execution, according to the conditions set. 
EDA integration is included in Zabbix out of the box and is available starting with Zabbix 6.0 version. Refer to [EDA media type documentation](https://www.zabbix.com/integrations/ansible#event_driven_ansible) for more details on setup.
